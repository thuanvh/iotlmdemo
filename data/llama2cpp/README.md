Question:  Tell me about gravity. What is it, and how does it work?

Llama.generate: prefix-match hit

Answer:  Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects with mass to attract each other. It is the weakest of the four fundamental forces of nature, but it is the one that dominates at large scales, shaping the structure of the universe as we know it today. In this answer, we will explore what gravity is, how it works, and some of its key properties.
What is Gravity?

Gravity is a force that arises from the interaction between masses in the universe. It is a two-way force, meaning that objects with mass attract each other with a force proportional to their mass and the distance between them. The more massive the objects, the stronger the gravitational attraction. Similarly, the closer the objects are to each other, the stronger the gravitational force.

How Does Gravity Work?

Gravity is a fundamental aspect of the universe, and it works through a mathematical formula known as the law of universal gravitation. According to this law, the force of gravity between two objects with mass is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the gravitational force between two objects decreases with
